###How to install

###How to fix "adr.sPokemonGo.app.zip" yourself

0. Clone this project.

###For Jailbreak User
If you're a jailbreak user, you just need to install the PokemonGo Cracked ipa with iTune or XCode. You can find the ipa version PokemonGo in "adr.sPokemonGo.ipa.zip" at [my release page](https://github.com/aaaddress1/PokemonHook/releases).

**p.s. You need to install some tweak for bypassing signature checking or jailbreak cheaking, e.g.tsProtector, AppSync**
